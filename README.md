# react-contacts-app
Simple contacts application using React cli create-react-app. I built the majority of this application in a few hours using Mock JSON data for contacts. It's currently a work in progress which I plan on adding more features and design elements to. 

# Tools 
* create-react-app cli
* React MDL material design
* json-server

# Start App
Clone repo, install, cd into folder and run:
```git
npm install
npm start
```
Install json-server globally
```git
npm install -g json-server --save
```
Open new terminal window in project root folder and run:
```git
json-server --watch db.json --port 3004
```
